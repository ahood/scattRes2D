This repository contains code for quantum scattering resonances in 2D. 
Look in code/demos/ for examples. Look in notes/ for theoretical
underpinnings (thesis.pdf, esp. Chapters 2 and 5) and a manual for a detailed
description of the code itself (manual.pdf).

NOTES:
- You have to have chebfun (http://www.chebfun.org/) installed and on your path.
- The axisymmetric versions of the problem objects are not described in the manual
  but are used in a way similar to the non-axisymmetric ones.
- Issues are annotated with "TODO".
