\section{The sparse versions}
\label{sec-scattering_sparse}

In the preceding sections we've discussed objects that 
store the matrices that build the operator $T(k)$. 
A sufficiently fine discretization will make those
matrices too big to store. The alternative is to 
have routines to apply the matrix $T(k)$ instead of 
forming it, because an iterative solver will still
allow us to solve the scattering and resonance problems.
The sparse objects act pretty much the same way as their
counterparts as shown in the following and detailed
in the following sections:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 {\tt scattResComp2d} 
 &\qquad\leftrightarrow\qquad
 {\tt scattResComp2d\_sparse} \\ 
 {\tt dirBC}
 &\qquad\leftrightarrow\qquad
 {\tt dirBC\_sparse} \\ 
 {\tt pmlBC}
 &\qquad\leftrightarrow\qquad
 {\tt pmlBC\_sparse} \\ 
 {\tt DtNBC}
 &\qquad\leftrightarrow\qquad
 {\tt DtNBC\_sparse}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
