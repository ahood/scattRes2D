\section{True solution for axisymmetric case}

Here we take a potential V supported on $R_1 < r < R_2$ and equal to
$V_0$ there.
Given incident wave $e^{ikx}$, we assume the total wave solution is the
sum of the incident wave and some outgoing scattered wave. This means
that after taking the Fourier transform of everything and requiring
that the coefficients be the same,
\[
 \psi_{tot} = \begin{cases}
               aJ_n(kr) & (r < R_1) \\
               bJ_n(\tilde{k}r) + cY_n(\tilde{k}r) & (R_1 < r < R_2) \\
               dH_n(kr) + \underbrace{i^nJ_n(kr)}_{\text{incident}} & ( r > R_2)
              \end{cases}
\]
where $\tilde{k} = \sqrt{k^2-V_0}$.
Once we impose the usual $\mathcal{C}^1$ interface conditions at
$R_1$ and $R_2$, the coefficients are obtained. Writing that out isn't
interesting and it's already coded.
